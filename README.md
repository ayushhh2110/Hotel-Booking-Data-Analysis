Hotel Booking Data Analysis 🏨📊

This project analyzes 100,000+ hotel booking records to uncover patterns in customer behavior, cancellations, and booking preferences. The goal was to identify factors influencing booking outcomes and provide actionable insights for improving customer retention and revenue strategies.

🔑 Key Steps

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing → Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure dataset quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Investigated trends in cancellations, lead times, and seasonal booking patterns.

Visualization → Created clear and interactive plots (heatmaps, bar charts, line plots) using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

Insights →

City hotels received more bookings than resort hotels.

Longer lead times correlated with higher cancellation rates.

Couples formed the majority of customers, followed by families.

Distribution channels (especially online travel agents) significantly impacted booking volume.
